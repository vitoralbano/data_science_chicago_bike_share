This is the first deliverable project from the Data Science I course on the Udacity's platform

# Explore data from shared bikes in Chicago
This project consists on solving these twelve questions below using the dataset.

1. Print the data_list second line
2. Print the data_list first 20 lines
3. Create a function that return a data list from a column in data_list
4. Using the function from the previous question, count how many registers with 'male' and 'female' are in gender's column
5. Create a function to solve the previous question and return a list where the first value is the 'Male' and 'Female' in second
6. Create a function that return the most popular gender in the data_list
7. Create a chart for the 'Quantity by user types' using matplotlib
8. Answer a logical question about the context of data available
9. Find informations and statistics about the trip's duration, like, maximum, minimum, mean and median from the trip's durations
10. Count the single values from a column using 'set()'
11. Assert that the created functions agree with the good practices terms
12. Challenge question: Create a function that return a two lists, the first one with the kinds of the data, and the second one with the respective counter. 
Ex: ['Male', 'Female'] [200, 175] or ['Customer', 'Subscriber'] [435, 502]
